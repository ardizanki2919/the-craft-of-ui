What if you could build anything you see? Not just copy a design, but really understand it. To break it down. To know which tools to reach for. To create it with precision, performance, and accessibility in mind. To make it feel right and make it your own.

Building user interfaces is complex. Even something as "simple" as a sign-up form can involve countless small decisions: the motion, the accessibility, the invisible layers of care. And too often, education only covers slices of that complexity.

You might learn how to make something look good. Or move well. But what about making it work right? What about building for everyone? making things fast, inclusive, and resilient?

__The Craft of UI__ is a course about how to build things well. Itâ€™s about learning how to see like a developer who understands design, and code like a developer who cares about users.

Itâ€™s about working with the web â€” not fighting it. Leveraging the power of HTML and CSS. Sprinkling in just the right amount of JavaScript when it adds real magic. And reaching for libraries only when they truly help you go further. Itâ€™s not about chasing trends or selling you "taste". Itâ€™s about timeless skills that level you up and pay the bills. Tools change. APIs evolve. But the foundations of the web platform are your unfair advantage when mastered.

You don't need to be "a natural". You just need the right approach. The right mindset. With practice, you become the person who can build anything. This course is for builders, designers, and doers â€” from beginners ready to go deep, to experienced devs looking to level up.

Youâ€™ll learn to:
- Think through UI problems, not just code them
- Use the platform to its fullest before reaching for a dependency
- Know when (and why) to reach for libraries or frameworks
- Explore emerging browser APIs so youâ€™re ready when they land
- Build fast, accessible, resilient UIs that make people go "wow"


Over the years, Iâ€™ve built a reputation for being able to recreate just about anything passed my way on the web. But the truth is, itâ€™s not all "tricks". Itâ€™s about approach, curiosity, and knowing how to think through a UI challenge, not just code it. I want to teach you how I do it â€” how I see a UI, break it down, and build it back up. This course is everything Iâ€™ve learned about the craft, shared step-by-step, from over a decade of experience.

If youâ€™ve ever looked at an interface and wondered, "How would I build that?", this is for you. It's about seeing a design and thinking "I know how to build that, and build it right". It's about equipping you with the skills to build whatever you need, and the confidence to say, "Iâ€™ve got this".

And when you can do that? Everything changes. You're not stuck chasing snippets. You're not limited by tools or libraries. You become the tool. You become the documentation. You move fast and solve problems confidently like it's second nature.

You can bring any idea to life and make it feel effortless.
It's not just satisfying, itâ€™s how you 10x your career. You become the person the team turns to when they say: "Can we even build this?". Could you become that person? Yes. You can. And I'll show you how.

<h2 class="text-fluid">Hey â€“ I'm Jhey Tompkins ðŸ¤™</h2>
<JheyStack/>
I'm a web developer who loves making things feel magical on the web whilst showing others how to do the same.

Currently, I'm a [Design Engineer at Vercel](https://vercel.com/design). Before that I worked in [Developer Relations at Google](https://developer.chrome.com/s/results?q=jhey) as part of the [CSS and UI](https://web.dev/s/results?q=jhey) team on Chrome. Along the way, I've built for brands like Nike, Uber, Nearform, and Monzo.

Over the years I've shared thousands of demos with the community resulting in a [following on X](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=jh3yy) of over 120,000+ people and 18,000+ on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/jh3y) (of which many have asked for this course). It's given me the opportunity to [speak at conferences](https://youtu.be/loKm4JcT4U4) all over the world about building user interfaces and it's opened doors to opportunities at companies like Google and Vercel.

People now know me for turning complex challenges into simple, delightful experiences. For building things that make you say "wait, how did you do that?" and for doing it with the web platform and good craft.

This course is my way of sharing everything I've learned across my career. From the fundamentals to the fun stuff. Not just how to build things that work, but how to build things that wow. Whether you're just getting started or you're the person the team turns to when things get tricky, I want to help you level up your skills and build with confidence. Let's go.
