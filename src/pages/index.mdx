What if you could build anything you see? Not just copy a design, but really understand it. To break it down. To know which tools to reach for. To create it with precision, performance, and accessibility in mind. To make it feel right and make it your own.

Building user interfaces is complex. Even something as simple as a sign-up form can involve countless small decisions — the motion, the accessibility, the invisible layers of care. And too often, education only covers slices of that complexity.

You might learn how to make something look good. Or move well. But what about making it work right? What about building for everyone? What about making decisions that hold up in the real world — where things need to be fast, inclusive, and resilient?

__The Craft of UI__ is a course about how to build things well. It’s about learning how to see like a developer who understands design, and code like a developer who cares about users.

It’s about working with the web — not fighting it. Using the incredible primitives of the platform to go further with less. Leveraging the power of HTML and CSS. Reaching for JavaScript where it makes sense. And using libraries when and where it makes sense. Building deliberately — with clarity, confidence, and craft.

Over the years, I’ve built a reputation for being able to recreate just about anything passed my way on the web. But the truth is, it’s not all "tricks". It’s about approach, curiosity, and knowing how to think through a UI challenge, not just code it.

I want to teach you how I do it — how I see a UI, break it down, and build it back up. This course is everything I’ve learned about the craft, shared step-by-step, from over a decade of experience.

If you’ve ever looked at an interface and wondered, "How would I build that?" — this is for you. It's about seeing a design and thinking "I know how to build that — and build it right". It's about equipping you with the skills to build whatever you need, and the confidence to say, "I’ve got this".

And when you can do that? Everything changes. You're not stuck chasing snippets or relying on dependencies or even battling them. You can move fast and build with confidence soling problems like it's second nature.

You become the person on the team who just makes things work.
You can bring any idea to life — and make it feel effortless.
It's not just satisfying — it’s how you 10x your career.
